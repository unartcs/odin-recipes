                        Add the butter and garlic to a deep skillet and sauté over medium heat for one minute.

                        Add the fettuccine to the skillet along with the vegetable broth and stir to combine.
                        <br>Its okay if the broth doesn't fully submerge the pasta.

                </li>
                <li>

                        Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the broth to come up to a boil.
                        <br>When it reaches a boil, give the pasta a quick stir, replace the lid, then turn the heat down to medium-low.
